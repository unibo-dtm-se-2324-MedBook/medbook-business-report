# Future work and Planned enhancements

This project has been designed with extensibility in mind. Several features and architectural improvements are planned for future iterations to further enhance usability, security, and overall functionality.

## Project Improvements

1. **Password Recovery**: implementation of a secure password and account recovery mechanism via email. This feature will send a link and instructions for access recovery via email.

2. **Account Deletion Functionality**: add a user-facing option to permanently delete an account, including all associated personal data, in compliance with data protection and privacy regulations.

3. **Smooth Page Transitions**: introduce animated and seamless transitions between application pages to improve user experience and provide a more polished, modern interface.

## Project Evolution

1. **User Roles and Access Control**: introduce role-based access control by distinguishing between patients and medical professionals (doctors). Each role will have a dedicated set of permissions and capabilities.

2. **Extended Doctor Capabilities**: medical professionals will be granted advanced features, such as:
    * Securely sending medical documents and prescriptions to patients within the application
    * Assigning medications and defining intake schedules for patients
    * Creating and managing personalized treatment plans and reminder schedules

3. **Medication Intake Reminders**: enhance the reminder system for medication intake, including configurable schedules, notifications, and daily alerts to support adherence to treatment plans.

These enhancements aim to evolve the application from a personal medical assistant into a _collaborative digital health platform_ that supports both patients and healthcare providers.
