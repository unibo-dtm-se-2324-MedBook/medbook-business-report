## Abstract

MedBook is a privacy-first mobile app that brings all your health information together in one clean, organized space. No more folders stuffed with papers or photos scattered across devices - everything that matters to your health lives in **MedBook**, neatly structured and always at hand.

### Why MedBook

Healthcare is messy: prescriptions, lab results, imaging, notes, reminders. MedBook replaces piles of paper and fragmented files with a single, intuitive hub. It helps you stay on top of medications, keep records centralized, and make safer decisions with basic, personalized risk checks.

### Here you will find:

- **Medication Schedule and Daily Reminder** - create a monthly schedule for your medications;
- **Secure Document Vault** - upload all your medical files;
- **Pill Risk Check** - get a check of potential pill risks using your sex, age, and country of origin.

### Notes and Disclaimer

MedBook is intended to help you organize health information and build better routines. It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult your healthcare professional for decisions about medications or therapies.
