# ![icon of logo](image.png) MedBook - Your Personal Medical Hub

MedBook is a privacy-first mobile app that brings all your health information together in one clean, organized space. No more folders stuffed with papers or photos scattered across devices - everything that matters to your health lives in **MedBook**, neatly structured and always at hand.

**Why MedBook**

Healthcare is messy: prescriptions, lab results, imaging, notes, reminders. MedBook replaces piles of paper and fragmented files with a single, intuitive hub. It helps you stay on top of medications, keep records centralized, and make safer decisions with basic, personalized risk checks.

**Here you will find:**

- **Medication Schedule and Daily Reminder** - create a monthly schedule for your medications;
- **Secure Document Vault** - upload all your medical files;
- **Pill Risk Check** - get a check of potential pill risks using your sex, age, and country of origin.
