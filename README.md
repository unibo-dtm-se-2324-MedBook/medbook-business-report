  MedBook – Your Personal Medical Hub
</h1>

MedBook is a privacy-first mobile app that brings all your health information together in one clean, organized space. No more folders stuffed with papers or photos scattered across devices - everything that matters to your health lives in **MedBook**, neatly structured and always at hand.

**Why MedBook**

Healthcare is messy: prescriptions, lab results, imaging, notes, reminders. MedBook replaces piles of paper and fragmented files with a single, intuitive hub. It helps you stay on top of medications, keep records centralized, and make safer decisions with basic, personalized risk checks.

The application provides the following **core functionalities**:
* Secure user authentication and session management;
* Medication scheduling with a monthly calendar view;
* Uploading and managing medical documents (PDFs and images);
* Drug risk analysis using external medical data sources;
* User profile management;
* Notification and reminder support.

The system is implemented using *Python* and the *Flet* framework for the user interface, with *Firebase* services used for authentication, data persistence, and file storage, and *API* connection for drug risk check.

This repository contains the business report for the MedBook project. The code documentation lives in a separate repository: [MedBook - application code](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2324-MedBook/medbook-application-core)
